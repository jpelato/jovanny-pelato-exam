Starting with jam donuts, meat pies, seafood, a quick oyster shot, and finally the legendary dim sim!\n\n2. Industry Beans - https://goo.gl/maps/ZEnA2so2xScVQ4CM9 \nNext up on this Australian food tour we’re having coffee - and in Melbourne they take coffee culture seriously.\n\n3. Terror Twilight - https://goo.gl/maps/CcBrVwo1qrdZGECM6 \nJust like coffee culture, Australian brunch culture is very strong, and they have influenced the world with brunch, and of course - avocado toast.\n\n4: Big Esso (Mabu Mabu) - https://goo.gl/maps/5WrjENeqZS8VojrU7 \nI wouldn’t want to make a video about what Australian food is without original indigenous Australian food. Big Esso is one of the few true Australian restaurants where Chef Nornie Bero from the Torres Straits serves modern Australian dishes using only local ingredients. Emu, saltbush, and green ants!\n\n5: The Napier Hotel: https://goo.gl/maps/8VguVAZWeVJFMBoM7 \nAnother part of Australian food culture is the Australian pub.

We were lucky to see the entire cooking process from start to finish. One of the traditional foods of the Tay People is five colored sticky rice, each color made from a natural coloring and steamed. Along with the sticky rice we had a huge assortment of pork dishes, including fresh blood and organ sausage, boiled meat, grilled meat, and probably my favorite of the meal - roasted duck stuffed with Kumquat leaves.\n\nWhen the food was ready, they presented it on trays over banana leaves with a chili dipping sauce. Food in Northern Vietnam is not only about eating, but it’s about socializing, talking, drinking, and eating together. \n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n🌶 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n🎥 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)\n\n🇹🇭 Bangkok Food Tour Available now: https://bangkokvanguards.com/experiences-2/the-ultimate-bangkok-foodtour/ \n\n🔔 Subscribe: Thank you for watching this street food tour, remember to Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/@MarkWiens for more food and travel!', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAkFFjaencA/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAkFFjaencA/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAkFFjaencA/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAkFFjaencA/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAkFFjaencA/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-05-13 13:00:18'),

I chose one of the biggest they had - though not that huge. And in approximately 15 seconds it was lobster sashimi. It was so fresh and so sweet, and the lobster head was made into a delicious miso soup.

Today we’re going on a Japanese food tour to try some of the most popular noodles dishes.\n\n#1 Hakata Ramen (Tonkotsu) - There’s no doubt this is one of the most important noodles dishes of Fukuoka, and one of the most famous versions of ramen in Japan - tonkotsu ramen or locally known as Hakata ramen. We went to an old school spot that hasn’t changed in decades. It was one of the best bowls of tonkotsu ramen I’ve ever had.\nHakuryuken https://goo.gl/maps/YiXfVr2Fa78LtFZQ9 \nPrice - 1,150 JPY ($8.68)\n\n#2 Udon - Next up for udon, another Japanese noodle classic. Udon is thick and hearty. We went to a very well known udon restaurant in Fukuoka, and actually you can order from three different sizes, yet they each cost the same amount, and depending on hours (in the afternoon when we came), you can get unlimited re-fills of noodles - so it’s all you can eat udon! I had the hugest bowl possible and it was at least three normal bowls of udon. I was pretty full after eating it all so I didn’t need more!\nShungetsuan Shotenjimae: https://goo.gl/maps/usa7oGeznwikVbb48 \nPrice - 800 JPY ($6.04 all you can eat udon noodles)\n\n#3 Champon - The last dish is champon, especially famous from Nagasaki, south of Fukuoka on Kyushu island. It’s a totally different noodle dish concept where a heap of vegetables are stir fried and then topped like a mountain on top of noodles with thick pork bone broth. It looks huge, but goes down quite easily as it mainly consists of bean sprouts and cabbage.\nIde Champon Odo: https://goo.gl/maps/HLbTzCkbQjQNANhK6 \nPrice - 970 JPY ($7.32)\n\nAll three noodle dishes were fantastic and you don’t want to miss any of them when you’re in Fukuoka, Japan!\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n——————————————————\n\n🌶️ 🌶️🌶️ NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2hzdBm0saZU/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2hzdBm0saZU/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2hzdBm0saZU/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2hzdBm0saZU/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2hzdBm0saZU/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-03-25 13:00:04'),

Today is an extra cold day, snowing and so instead of driving we decided to take the train to get to Yanagawa - from Fukuoka it took about an hour.\n\nYanagawa is a very pleasant town, located along the beautiful Japanese coast, and home to plenty of fresh seafood and something they are most famous for; unagi, or eel. When it comes to Japanese food, Yanagawa is one of the capitals of eel! But first, we took a traditional boat ride through the canal system to enjoy the peace and natural beauty of the town.\n\nEel restaurant 1: Saraya Fukuryu: https://goo.gl/maps/qLu4wLXwkWPTdR4ZA\nWhile on the boat ride, I could smell the smoky aroma of eels being grilled and it was almost unbearable, so we decided to try our first eel - and this was a recommendation from our boat captain. The eel was delicious and fresh, caramelized with a sweet soy sauce glaze, and served over rice in a wooden lacquer box. It was my first taste of Yanagawa eel… but more and better coming up! \nTotal price - 8,150 JPY ($63.48 USD) for 2 boxes\n\nAlien Fish Seafood Shop: https://goo.gl/maps/3d3KwsGX3Ph8VpC17\nNext up we went to a legendary seafood restaurant, more like a seafood market with a restaurant in the back. They had a nice catch, but one of their specialties is alien fish - literally alien fish - something otherworldly which they catch right off the coast of Yanagawa. They recommended some as sashimi and some deep fried. I also tried a number of other dishes, all of which were as fresh as possible and delicious.\nTotal price - 8,800 JPY ($68.54 USD) for everything\n\nMain eel restaurant: Ganso Motoyoshiya: https://goo.gl/maps/xDbBq9d63dvNt2GK8 \nFinally we made it to our main reservation for the main meal of the day and the most highly regarded and renowned Japanese eel restaurant in Yanagawa; Ganso Motoyoshiya. They’ve literally been serving their eel recipe since 1681. I was extremely lucky to have a chance to enter the kitchen to see just how they grill the eels to perfection, dip them into the sauce, grill again, and then place them over rice in a wooden box before steaming it altogether. This style of serving unagi / eel, which is called Unagi no Seiromushi, is unique to Yanagawa and one of the signatures of Ganso Motoyoshiya. I went all out and ordering the biggest set includes 3 types of eel. It was outstanding!\nTotal price - 21,700 JPY ($157.94 USD), but my set cost 8,200 JPY ($59.71 USD)\n\nYanagawa is a fantastic town to visit on a day trip from Fukuoka to enjoy the peace of the canals and especially the delicious Yanagawa eels, and quick alien fish sashimi!\n\nThank you to Visit Kyushu (https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/) for helping me organize this food tour.\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n——————————————————\n\n🌶️ 🌶️🌶️ NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PMzfTPgM5pg/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PMzfTPgM5pg/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PMzfTPgM5pg/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PMzfTPgM5pg/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PMzfTPgM5pg/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-03-11 13:00:27'),

The sea is so clean and fresh and that’s exactly how the oysters taste. Once you arrive they have a variety of live seafood and especially oysters that you can choose from. Then you go to your table and grill everything. These oysters can be eaten raw or grilled, but most like to grill them. It’s a great Japanese food eating experience especially with family and friends. \nTotal price - 8,100 JPY\n\n2nd Oyster Hut: https://goo.gl/maps/ejt5eDAeDXrqDJiK8\nWe continued with this Japanese oyster hut tour to the second place, which was past Itoshima. This next oyster hut was more a of a local family home where they have opened up their backyard and garage to host seafood loving customers. I immediately loved this place and how family oriented it is - they catch and harvest all their own seafood. When she showed me the giant record-breaking abalone, I immediately had to order it. Grandma came out to slice it perfectly into sashimi and she recommended we eat half of it raw and half of it grilled with some oysters. They even had citrus in the backyard we could use for our oyster meal.

They have done an amazing job to preserve the culture of “yatai” or portable street food stalls that set up in the evening across the city. Tonight we’re going on an ultimate Japanese street food tour in Fukuoka, going to 5 different place for 5 Japanese dishes and I can’t wait to share all the food with you now.\n\n#1 Yaki Ramen\nLocation: Kokinchan: https://goo.gl/maps/AMGdvUadJR6JbFwi6 - We’re starting off with a famous yatai stall where they invented the original yaki ramen - or fried ramen. It was definitely new to me, I thought it would be more of a dry fried noodles, but it was rather a wet and soup fried noodle dish. Amazing, as were the other dishes.\nPrice - 2,650 JPY for everything\n\n#2 Gyoza\nLocation: Yatai Mamichan: https://goo.gl/maps/dwSFjcZea59H947D8 - You can go on a Japanese street food tour without eating gyoza, and Yatai Mamichan is one of the best places to eat them. The chef is amazingly skilling, cooking everything on his own and darting from station to station. Part of the great thing about eating at Yatai is being right in front of the cooking and interacting with the chef.\nPrice - 8,450 JPY for 5 people (we ordered a lot and lots of drinks)\n\n#3 Tempura - Next, I’m not totally sure of the name of this place, but they are known for their tempura, battered and deep fried seafood and vegetables.

Today we’re taking a ferry to the Farasan Islands, beautiful Red Sea islands where the people are extremely friendly and the culture is so pure and authentic. We’ll be touring around the island, trying some of the local food, and then the highlight will be a full Farasan Islands seafood meal on the beach - everything home cooked. It’s going to be an incredible day of Red Sea Arabian food, and I can’t wait to share it all with you now!\n\nJazan City - 40 kilometers off the coast of Jazan, Saudi Arabia, within the Red Sea are the Farasan Islands. There are around 80 different islands, home to a just a small population of around 12,000 permanent residents - many of whom still maintain their local traditions. To get there, you take a short 1 hour ferry ride, and when you arrive you can actually feel this sense of relaxation and friendliness when you arrive.\n\nLocal breakfast - we first headed to a local spot to have a quick breakfast of deep fried batter, some a little sweet and some with a little curry powder taste. It was a perfect way to get started. Afterwards to we continued on to the market. Unfortunately the fish auction only takes place in the afternoon, so we weren’t able to see it, but we did meet some very friendly locals and try some of the local Farasan islands melons.\n\nHuge seafood meal - Finally to complete this amazing day in the Farasan Islands, we were invited to a local seafood cookout on the beach to make some of the traditional foods of Farasan Islands; Marsah - mashed banana bread pudding; Sayadiyeh - fish with rice; Megash - sesame oil fish; Helba - fenugreek sauce are just a few of the wonderful dishes. I loved the meal and the atmosphere and our incredible new friends. The food was all fantastic, but I think the highlight was the megash - fish boiled in sesame oil, something truly delicious and something you have to eat when you’re in the Farasan Islands.\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n——————————————————\n\n🌶️ 🌶️🌶️ NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGJcEj0Gjyc/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGJcEj0Gjyc/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGJcEj0Gjyc/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGJcEj0Gjyc/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGJcEj0Gjyc/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-02-28 13:00:11'),

Their main shawarma is made from chicken, marinated perfectly and served in house made bread with garlic sauce and pickles.

This is a must eat when you’re in Saudi Arabia!\n\nHome meal in Riyadh - Next up we we were kindly invited over to the home of Turkey who invited to share a meal with his family. Typically every weekend they gather together to cook and eat. Today, Uncle made his famous mandi, and we also had braised camel. The meal was outstanding, laying over a bed of rice and all of us coming together for the feast. We also sat by the fire, enjoyed each others company and a variety of different snacks and Saudi Arabian delicacies - and of course Saudi coffee and sweet tea. It was truly a remarkable experience and display of genuine hospitality.\n\nKabsa with Hisham - Huge thanks to Hisham: https://www.youtube.com/@misho_baeshen/ - Finally to round up this tour, we headed over to Hisham’s house where he cooked orange kabsa, what is probably the national food of Saudi Arabia and his particular recipe originating from his family in Makkah.

It’s a unique part of Saudi Arabia, where some of the world’s most prized coffee in grown and where the mix of culture and food is unlike other parts of the country. Today we have the privilege to visit a local coffee farm where a local family will be cooking a full goat haneed in the backyard.\n\nWe began our journey from Jizan city, in the Jazan province of Saudi Arabia. The city is located on the Red Sea, yet just an hour drive away to Fayfa, and you’re transported high into the rugged green mountains that are famous for generations of coffee farming.\n\nCoffee is more than just a drink here, it’s a symbol of hospitality and a gesture of welcome. The coffee is much different than your typical Americano - it’s roasted very lightly, and brewed with cardamom and saffron for a unique fragrance. Rather than using sugar, coffee is served black, but with dates so you can alternate between sips of coffee and sweet dates. The combination is perfect.\n\nAfter a welcome and coffee, we lit the outdoor wood fire oven, and then took a tour of the farm to learn about the prized Khawlani coffee beans. The farming practice has been passed down for generations in this area. Along with coffee, there were many medical edible herbs throughout the mountain.\n\nBack to the oven, we loaded up an entire goat, along with big handfuls of sour dough, scented with the aroma green leaves. The oven was closed tight for a couple of hours to seal in all the steam and smoke. This cooking technique is common in Saudi Arabia and really does a great job of smoking, baking, and steaming all at the same time.\n\nThe time finally came, and we dished out all the tender goat on the rice trays. There were also a number of side dishes, including fresh buttermilk served in a smoky wooden bowl, a variety of doughs served with ghee, and possibly the highlight for me; helba, a sudsy fenugreek sauce that’s definitely a unique flavor, and loved in this region.\n\nIt was a meal I’ll never forget, in this friendly coffee village in the mountains of Jazan!\n\nHisham: https://www.youtube.com/@misho_baeshen/\n \nThank you to Visit Saudi Arabia for arranging my food trip to Saudi Arabia!\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n——————————————————\n\n🌶️ 🌶️🌶️ NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2n2tsFiPcc/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2n2tsFiPcc/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2n2tsFiPcc/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2n2tsFiPcc/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2n2tsFiPcc/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-02-11 13:00:28'),

They specialize in locally caught seafood from the Red Sea and all seafoods are displayed in a cabinet so you can see what you want to choose. Along with crabs, shrimp and lobster, one of the greatest fish from the Red Sea is a najel fish. The fish was deep fried and seasoned afterwards with a light blend of spices. The entire meal was fantastic, everything fresh, nothing overpowering the delicious seafood. I also really enjoyed the rice, which Hisham mentioned is only eaten when you eat fish.\n\nAl-Balad - Is the historical center of Jeddah and also a  UNESCO World Heritage site. Walking through the narrow streets, it’s truly magnificent to see the preservation of the old town and how it’s still functioning in everyday life. We stopped at a museum and for a quick cup of Saudi coffee while we explored.\n\nOlfat Al Halawani (https://goo.gl/maps/Hp2AGJHYWRsAYwfU7) - Motabbaq is an Arabian food that’s influenced so many similar dishes around the world. To make it, they slap out thin dough, fill it with a combination of herbs, eggs, minced meat, and spices, wrap it up into a packet and cook it over a hot plate. When you eat it, you sprinkle it first with lemon, and chase it with a green chili. It was fantastic, highly recommended, and it’s especially famous to eat in the evening in Jeddah.\n\nLamb head mandi - For one more night snack we stopped at a restaurant to eat lamb head mandi, a dish where the lamb is falling off the bone - quite literally falling off the head - it’s then chopped up and sprinkled with cumin and salt. Each bite melts in your mouth, from the tongue to the cheeks.\n\nJeddah is an incredible city to visit in Saudi Arabia with an exciting food culture!\n\nThank you to Visit Saudi Arabia for arranging my food trip to Saudi Arabia!\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n——————————————————\n\n🌶️ 🌶️🌶️ NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-BGeXIUucg/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-BGeXIUucg/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-BGeXIUucg/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-BGeXIUucg/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-BGeXIUucg/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-02-07 13:00:09'),

Today I’m taking you on an ultimate local Saudi Arabian food tour of Riyadh, we’ll be eating some of the greatest dishes, food you don’t want to miss!\n\nHere are all the locations featured in this food review:\n\n1. Fawal Abo Salem (https://goo.gl/maps/TyzPpWvigqEM5JcZ6)  - We’re beginning this Saudi Arabian food tour in Riyadh with a staple breakfast - ful - mashed fava beans that likely originate in Egypt, but are widely popular throughout the entire region. Ful medames at Fawal Abo Salem for breakfast is some of the best in the entire city - and I was blown away by the quality and flavor, paired with the freshly baked bread.\n\n2. Camel liver - I’m not totally sure of the name of this place, but they are famous for their fried camel liver, sauteed down with onions and peppers. It’s truly tasty, right off the hot griddle with fresh bread and a dash of hot sauce.\n\n3. Alnaqaa Falafel & Hummus (https://goo.gl/maps/SzCLzQTAteZVUHc76) - To eat the best Falafel and Hummus and Riyadh, you have to go to Alnaqaa - it’s absolutely legendary, and it felt as though I was right back on the streets of Beirut. One of their specialties is a giant falafel stuffed with caramelized onions. And make sure you order the entire falafel mountain!\n\n4. Kebda Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/6advt5emgE6eoUfRA) - This Riyadh food tour is not complete with only camel liver - another popular liver to eat is lamb liver, and this time it’s not served on a plate, but with bread, sandwich style. Some of the tastiest lamb liver you’ll ever try!\n\n5. Sudah Restaurant (https://goo.gl/maps/FprxbXE6A4TdMmkdA) - To begin this food tour and to end this food tour, it was a privilege to spend some time at Sudah Restaurant to learn about Haneed, an Arabian food that at this restaurant originates from Aseer Province. They still make it the traditional way, loading parted out young lambs into an underground oven, layered with a specific type of hay that holds in the moisture and gives a distinct fragrance. The result is smokey lamb served over a mountain of rice, that literally melts in your mouth with the smoky fragrance of the hay. It was an unforgettable meal experience in Saudi Arabia!\n\nAnd that wraps up this ultimate Saudi Arabian food tour in Riyadh, what a day of delicious food. \n\nThank you to Visit Saudi Arabia for arranging my food trip to Saudi Arabia!\n\n🎵MUSIC: \nhttps://goo.gl/HwVjdo\n\n——————————————————\n\n📱FOLLOW:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology\n\n——————————————————\n\n🌶️ 🌶️🌶️ NEW: Smoked Ghost Pepper Available Now: \nDirect: https://www.kivahealthfood.com/markghostpepper \nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ (affiliate link on Amazon in US)', '{\"high\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRFcoqQr2bc/hqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 480, \"height\": 360}, \"maxres\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRFcoqQr2bc/maxresdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720}, \"medium\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRFcoqQr2bc/mqdefault.jpg\", \"width\": 320, \"height\": 180}, \"default\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRFcoqQr2bc/default.jpg\", \"width\": 120, \"height\": 90}, \"standard\": {\"url\": \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRFcoqQr2bc/sddefault.jpg\", \"width\": 640, \"height\": 480}}', '2023-02-04 13:00:31'),

Today we’re going on an ultimate bbq tour in Bacolod, and we’re going to uncover the secret as to why it’s so good!\n\nThe Bacolod Food Hunters (https://bacolodfoodhunters.com/) - Huge thank you to Martin and the team from The Bacolod Food Hunters for taking me around in Bacolod and for showing me some of the best places to eat bbq!\n\nHere are the locations and the places we ate in this video:\n\nAida\'s Chicken (https://goo.gl/maps/enTN2NsSg71cAiySA) - We’re starting at Manokan Country, probably the most famous place in Bacolod for chicken inasal, and it’s really so incredibly iconic. There are a few dozen places to choose from, but Martin recommended Aida’s as one of the local favorites. We were lucky to get into the kitchen to see the grilling action, and it’s some of the most exciting grill action you’ll see! One of the secrets of chicken inasal, along with all the marinade, is the continual basting of chicken oil and anatto as its being grilled. This keeps the chicken juicy and moist, and when you eat it, you eat more chicken oil in the rice.\nTotal price - 687 PHP ($12.53) for everything.\n\nChai Rose Barbecue (https://goo.gl/maps/azVUccHJSSRMQCxj6) - To continue this Filipino food tour we went to another legendary bbq spot on Bacolod known as Chai Rose Barbecue. They have insasal as well, but their speciality is pork bbq skewers. The taste is sweet and salty and it goes great along with chicken oil rice as well.\n\nSilay City BBQ - We continued on to a small Filipino barbecue stall under a tree in Silay City. The family was so friendly and welcoming, and they have the full bbq spread of about 20 different skewers to choose from. The bbq was hot and delicious and especially good with Aunty’s homemade chili vinegar.\nTotal price - 170 PHP ($3.10)\n\nMan Plaza - Finally to complete this Filipino street food tour of barbecue and inasal in Bacolod we went to one more legendary place - a place that’s frequented by local students in the area - Man Plaza. It’s an entire bbq plaza all under one roof with about a dozen stalls to choose from. We chose a place called Royam’s.
